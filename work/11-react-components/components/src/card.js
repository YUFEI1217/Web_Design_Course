      description: "The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature.",
      para: "Ragdolls are often known as \"dog-like cats\" or \"puppy-like cats\", due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.",

      description: "Considered a medium-sized cat, Aegeans typically weigh 7-10 pounds. Though they often appear lean, these felines are still rather muscular. Their semi-long coat will appear in a bicolor or tricolor pattern, with white being the prominent color.",
      para: "Aegean cats are unique since they are a naturally occurring landrace of domestic catâ€”similar to the nearby Cyprus cat who resides on the island of the same name. Being a natural cat means that these felines have developed without any human interference.",

      alt: "Cat Laperm picture",
      description: "LaPerm cats are charming and curly-haired with gentle, affectionate personalities. Their wavy coat is the result of a mutated gene that was discovered in the 1980s, making them a relatively new breed. This breed's loving, lap cat tendencies and low-maintenance coat make them an easy, cuddly cat to live with.",
      para: "LaPerm cats are known for their curly coats, which are typically a blend of soft waves and springy curls, resembling the human perm hairstyle. Most LaPerms have tight ringlets of hair near the stomach, neck, and ears and relaxed waves on the rest of the body. Their unique coats are the result of the genetic mutation found in rex breeds, though the LaPerm isn't actually related to the Devon rex or Cornish rex.",
