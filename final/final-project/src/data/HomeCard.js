      para1: "With a maximum resolution of 720p while handheld and 1080p while docked, something that many big games don't even manage on Switch, you won't be gaming in crisp 4K on Nintendo's hardware.",

      para3: "The Switch OLED version has a 7-inch screen to play on when handheld, though, and games do look absolutely gorgeous on it, and while its modified Nvidia Tegra X1 platform might be showing its age, Nintendo's first-party games keep looking great on it nonetheless.",
      para4: "Plenty of its top games run at 60FPS thanks to Nintendo's rigorous quality control, but even if they're at 30FPS you can generally rely on solid performance from Nintendo's own games. Ports of games from other consoles tend to be more variable.",

      para4: "A PC allows for a more personalized and versatile experience. However, the PS5 offers a streamlined, optimized gaming experience with less hassle and potentially lower cost. It essentially boils down to what you value more.",
